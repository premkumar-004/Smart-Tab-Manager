‚ú® Key Features
Intelligent Consolidation: Save all your open tabs into a persistent, linked-list style manager. Each session is timestamped, so you'll never lose your work.

Memory Hibernation: Is your computer slowing down? Use the hibernate feature to "discard" tabs, instantly freeing up CPU and RAM without closing them. Click the tab again to wake it up.

Lightning-Fast Navigation: Use the "Go to Tab" feature to instantly switch between your open tabs. The implementation uses a Map data structure for maximum speed.

Full CRUD Control: You have full control over your saved tabs. Delete individual links or entire sessions with our intuitive interface.

Sleek Sliding UI: A clean, modern UI with a smooth sliding panel to switch between managing and navigating your tabs.
